1. Computing modular inverse
   If a and n are relatively prime, there exist integers x and y such that
   a * x + n * y = 1, and such integers may be found using the Euclidean
algorithm. Considering this equation modulo n, it follows that a * x = 1; i.e.,
x = a^(-1)(mod n).

3. Solving a linear congruence equation a * x = b (mod n).
   It is solvable iff the congruence b = 0 (mod d) with
   d = gcd(a, n) is solvable.

   then all the solutions can be formed from {x0 + k * n / d | k ∈ Z},
   where d = gcd(a, n). There are exactly d solutions in the complete
   residue system modulo n, namely {0, 1, ..., n - 1}.
